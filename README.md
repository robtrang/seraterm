This is a Serial Terminal for Foenix computers. 

This will be the first program i have written for these computers and it's going to target
A2560K and C256Jr as a first off.

Really it's just a way of me learning and building decent libraries of code for these platforms so i can 
build bigger and better things later on (including use of the sophisticated graphics capabilities 
in Vicky II and III)

Another main goal of this is so i can have something i can use every day - serial connection to Cisco equipment in my
office and/or to a Linux or FreeBSD system via their serial port - NULL Modem connectors :-)
